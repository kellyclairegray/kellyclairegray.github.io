            <p class="title">St. Louis, MO </p>
            <p>I am currently in my last semester as a Computer Science student at UK, and I excited about my future in this field! I started college as a mechanical engineering major, and eventually found my love for programming and switched majors. I really love front-end design and designing solutions that have the end user in mind. After graduation, I will be working as a software engineer.</p>
